## Adding a translation [[↑][index]]

First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute to this project!
Usually, the process of making a translation is quite **similar** to any other contribution, so follow the steps explained [here][new-features-hook].
The main **difference** are the steps in the [/src/lang/CONTRIBUTING.md][lang-contributing] file which explains how to tamper with the translation files and **add** a new **translation**.

You can even contribute by adding new enhancement and improvement **ideas** to the [ideas discussion][ideas-discussion] or lending someone a hand in the repository!
