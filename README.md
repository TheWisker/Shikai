<h2 align="center">Dependencies</h2>

The theme depends on [web-greeter](https://github.com/JezerM/web-greeter) or [nody-greeter](https://github.com/JezerM/nody-greeter) and their respective dependencies, plus lightdm.

<h2 align="center">Installation</h2>

Once all dependencies are installed, you just need to download [this](https://github.com/TheWisker/Shikai) github repo.

<h3>Script</h2>

To install using the script just execute the following bash files under ./scripts from the repo's root directory.

- `./scripts/w_install.sh` To install using web-greeter
- `./scripts/n_install.sh` To install using nody-greeter

Then, to set up a user profile image, copy the desired image to the user's home directory
renaming it to `.face`.

<h3>Arch Linux</h2>

To install using the aur with a custom aur helper run:

- `yay -S web-greeter-theme-shikai` Using `yay` aur helper for example

Then you should edit `/etc/lightdm/web-greeter.yml` 
to your liking focusing on the following lines:

- `theme: shikai`
- `background_images_dir: /usr/share/web-greeter/themes/shikai/assets/media/wallpapers/`
- `logo_image: /usr/share/web-greeter/themes/shikai/assets/media/logos/`

Then, to set up a user profile image, copy the desired image to the user's home directory
renaming it to `.face`.

<h3>Manually</h2>

Go to the `dist` folder and open the `index.html` and `monitor.html`files. Then find in both `window.__is_debug = true;`and change it to `window.__is_debug = false;`
Then copy the `dist` folder to `/usr/share/web-greeter/themes/`, renaming it from `dist` to `shikai`. Then you need to
change the line starting with `greeter-session=` in `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf` to `greeter-session=web-greeter` or 
`greeter-session=nody-greeter`, depending on which you have installed. You should edit `/etc/lightdm/web-greeter.yml` 
to your liking focusing on the following lines:

- `theme: shikai`
- `background_images_dir: /usr/share/web-greeter/themes/shikai/assets/media/wallpapers/`
- `logo_image: /usr/share/web-greeter/themes/shikai/assets/media/logos/`

Then, to set up a user profile image, copy the desired image to the user's home directory
renaming it to `.face`.

<h2 align="center">Configuration</h2>

The configuration becomes avaiable by hovering over the top-left corner of the window.
The behaviour and style settings are saved locally **only** when the configuration panel gets closed.
The themes configuration gets saved on theme creation, deletion and activation.

<h2 align="center">Troubleshooting</h2>

- Profile image not loading:

If you have added a .face image to you home folder and it does not load on theme it is because of the access permisions of the .face file. To fix this issue, copy the .face image to */var/lib/AccountsService/icons/* renaming it to your user's name. Once done, change its permisions with `chmod 644 /var/lib/AccountsService/icons` and `chmod 644 /var/lib/AccountsService/icons/username`. Lastly, create/modify the following configuration file */var/lib/AccountsService/users/username* including the following line: *Icon=/var/lib/AccountsService/icons/username*

- Incomplete loading:

On the odd case that the demo or the theme itself only loads the backgrounds or does not load the settings, it is most probably due
to a recent update that contains changes to the settings JSON structure. This can be fixed manually, looking at the errors in the developer console,
and manually adding the missing keys and values, or easier by [deleting the page's localStorage](https://intercom.help/scoutpad/en/articles/3478364-how-to-clear-local-storage-of-web-browser).
